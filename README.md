# Crowdfunding-ICP

This is ICP smart ontract that manages: creating campaigns, contributing to campaigns, tracking campaign progress, and distributing funds upon campaign completion.

## Overview

This is a Kickstarter like decentralized crowdfunding platform, where you can create and run campaigns or simply participate in the existing ones by providing contributions.
Campaigns have their owner, goal amount and end date. Only Campaign creator can manage his campaign, and other actors can contribute to the campaign they wish. Clients can list
all campaigns and choose the one they like. Campaign owner can withdraw collected contributions when the goal is reached.

  ### Try it out

  Now that we have our canister code, let us build and deploy our canister.

  - First, let us start our local Azle replica in the background . Run the following command in your terminal:
    `dfx start --background

  ### IMPORTANT NOTE

  If you make any changes to the StableBTreeMap structure like change datatypes for keys or values, changing size of the key or value, you need to restart dfx with the â€“clean flag. StableBTreeMap is immutable and any changes to it's configuration after it's been initialized are not supported.

  `dfx start --background --clean

  - Next, let us build and deploy our canister. Run the following command in your terminal:
    `dfx deploy

  If this is your first time running the command, which most likely it is, this may take a bit of time to boot up, so sit back and relax.
  Once its done, you should see a similar output:

- Deployed canisters.

### Interacting with our canister

We have two ways of interacting with our canister. We can either use the command line interface or the web interface. Let us start with the command line interface.

- Command line interface

`dfx canister call <canister_name> createCampaign '(record {title = "Campaign Title"; description = "Campaign Description"; goalAmount = <goal_amount>})'

`dfx canister call <canister_name> contribute '(record {campaignId = "<campaign_id>"; amount = <contribution_amount>})'

`dfx canister call <canister_name> withdrawFunds '(record {campaignId = "<campaign_id>"})'

`dfx canister call <canister_name> deleteCampaign '(record {campaignId = "<campaign_id>"})'

`dfx canister call <canister_name> getCampaign '(record {id = "<campaign_id>"})'

`dfx canister call <canister_name> getCampaigns '()'

`dfx canister call <canister_name> listContributions '(record {campaignId = "<campaign_id>"})'

- Web interface
  Just as we used the interface to get the message we just created in the previous section, you can use it add, update, delete, and get messages from your canister as well as call other functions you may add in your cannister.

Finally, you can shut down your local Azle replica by running the following command in your terminal:

`dfx stop
